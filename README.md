# IOT-Based-Car-Parking-System


The main motivation of this project is to reduce the traffic jam that occurs in the urban areas which are caused by vehicles searching for parking. In the newspapers, we saw many articles regarding the parking problem all over India. In India we are still using the manual vehicle parking system that why we are facing problems like wastage of time and energy finding free space across the parking surface when we need to park our car which requires a good amount of fuel. This project proposes an automated system where the parking ground will only open if it has free slots for parking. The user can also check it before arriving there by a website. It will save the time as well as reduce the gathering in front of parking area. This project also aims at better security for cars and personal property.

The working, uses and requirements for the project are discussed in the Projecr Report and Video.
